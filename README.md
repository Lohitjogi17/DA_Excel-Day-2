## 📊 Day 2: Excel Fundamentals - Mastering the Ribbon
This session focused on the essential formatting tools located in the Home Tab, which are critical for transforming raw data into professional, readable reports.
## Key Learnings
## 1. Font & Styling
Focused on visual hierarchy and readability using shortcuts to speed up the workflow:

Typography: Changing font styles and sizes (Alt + H + FF / FG).

Emphasis: Applying Bold, Italic, and Underline to highlight key headers.

Borders & Fills: Utilizing cell borders and background colors to distinguish data sets and improve structure.

## 2. Alignment & Cell Management
Ensuring data is positioned correctly for better scanning:

Text Positioning: Using Top, Middle, Bottom, and Left/Right alignments.

Wrap Text: Managing long strings of text within a single cell to maintain column width.

Merge & Center: Creating clean headers across multiple columns for report titles.

## 3. Number Formatting & Data Types
This is the most critical part of data integrity. I explored how Excel treats different data types:

General & Number: Standard numerical data.

Currency & Accounting: Proper formatting for financial values (using $ or other symbols).

Dates: Switching between Short and Long date formats to ensure chronological clarity.

Percentages & Fractions: Representing ratios accurately.

## 📝 Final Conclusion
Day 2 was about moving beyond just entering numbers and starting to communicate with data. Proper formatting isn't just about "making it look pretty"—it's about reducing cognitive load for the reader. By mastering number types (Currency vs. Accounting) and alignment techniques, I can now ensure that data is not only accurate but also interpretable and professional.
